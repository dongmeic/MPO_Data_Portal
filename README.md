This is a repository to track the data organization for the Central Lane Metropolitan Planning Organization Data Portal (https://www.thempo.org/887/Data). The process is coded in R. The repo folders are organized by data categories: crash, transit, traffic count, population, and commuter. Each folder includes a README.md to explain the data sources and data processing and R scripts to show the data processing. More information about datasets, dashboards and projects are shared on the WiKi pages.

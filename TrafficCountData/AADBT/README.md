# Explanations

Annual Average Daily Bicycle Traffic (AADBT) is the yearly total of bike counts on a given location divided by 365 days. Bike counts data can be both calculated from permanent counters data and derived from short-duration temporary counters data that are extrapolated to yearly counts. Daily bike counts aggregated from hourly counts are used as the response variable. The models are built to predict daily counts on the missing days and AADBT is calculated as the average.

## Data and scripts

Bike counts are collected by LCOG staff using both permanent and short-duration counters. The predictors are derived from a list of data sources, including NOAA, LRAPA, Strava, US Census, RLID and local governments, which covers weather, air quality, bike trips, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, roadway and bikeway characteristics, built environment and facility, and safety.

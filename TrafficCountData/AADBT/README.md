# Explanations

Annual Average Daily Bicycle Traffic (AADBT) is the yearly total of bike counts on a given location divided by 365 days. Bike counts data can be both calculated from permenant counters data and derived from short-duration temporary counters data that are extrapolated to yearly counts. Daily bike counts aggregated from hourly counts are used as the response variable. The models are built to predict daily counts on the missing days and AADBT is calcualted as the average.

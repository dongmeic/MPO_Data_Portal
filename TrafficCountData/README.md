# Explanations

Three databoards are in this data category and the scripts *ODOT_Counts.r* and *ODOT_Counts_Functions.r* in the **ODOT_Counts** folder are used to update the [Motorized Traffic Counts](https://www.lcog.org/thempo/page/motorized-traffic-counts) dashboard, which is updated monthly or periodly according to data availability. The [Bicycle Counts](https://www.lcog.org/thempo/page/bicycle-counts) and [Pedestrian Counts](https://www.lcog.org/thempo/page/pedestrian-counts) dashboards are managed by Kyle Overstake. The **AADBT** folder includes scripts to model the Annual Average Daily Bicycle Traffic. The **RegionalCounts** folder includes scripts to clean up regional traffic counts data.

## Data Sources

Data on traffic counts with length reports are provided by ODOT via email. Data on [AADBT](https://github.com/dongmeic/MPO_Data_Portal/tree/master/TrafficCountData/AADBT#explanations) are from NOAA, [Eco-Visio](https://www.eco-visio.net/v5/login/#::) and LCOG. Regional traffic counts are provided by Lane County. 

## Functions

A list of functions in the functions scripts are applied to convert string formats, read Excel sheets and files from a folder, reorganize and combine tables. Functions applied on the computation of AADBT are explained in [the folder](https://github.com/dongmeic/MPO_Data_Portal/tree/master/TrafficCountData/AADBT#explanations).

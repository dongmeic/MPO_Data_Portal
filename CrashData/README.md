# Explanations

Crash data is used in five mapping and five crash rates dashboards listed as below (scripts are linked to the **bold** ones):

1. Crash data mapping

        [Bicycle-Involved Crashes](https://www.lcog.org/916/Bicycle-Involved-Crashes) 

        [Pedestrian-Involved Crashes](https://www.lcog.org/917/Pedestrian-Involved-Crashes)

        [Advanced User Data](https://www.lcog.org/913/Advanced-User-Data)

        [Crash Conditions](https://www.lcog.org/938/Crash-Conditions)

2. [Population Crash Rates](https://www.lcog.org/891/Population-Crash-Rates)

3. [VMT Crash Rates](https://www.lcog.org/892/VMT-Crash-Rates)

4. [**Transportation Safety Emphasis Areas**](https://www.lcog.org/912/Transportation-Safety-Emphasis-Areas)

5. [**NHTSA Core Safety Measures**](https://www.lcog.org/899/NHTSA-Core-Safety-Measures)

Most of the dashboards above are connected with the LCOG data server and the computation is done in Tableau which is a continued effort from the former GIS staff Bill Clingman, except the two bolded dashboards. Due to the Lane Geographic Data Consortium migration, crash data structure has changed by removing the differentiation of vehicle and non-vehicle participant.The dashboard *Transportation Safety Emphasis Areas* requires input files from lane county crash geodatabase prepared by Jacob Blair.
